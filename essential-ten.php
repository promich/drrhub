		As disasters continue to rise and people demand more action from their governments to take preventive action, DRR is likely to become a significant political issue in the years to come. The effects of climate change such as droughts are known to lead to civil unrest and armed insurgencies, such as in southern Syria in the last few years. The increasing damage from disasters will also make the case for stronger governance and closer regional and international collaboration. </p>

                          <p>Recognized as one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, the Philippines needs to elect leaders and policymakers who can face up to the adversities brought about by climate change and disasters, various climate advocates said on Tuesday.
</p>

<p>In a statement, climate group Disaster Risk Reduction Network Philippines (DRRNetPhils) is urging voters in the coming May 2016 national and local elections to select candidates who will boost climate and disaster resilience in the country.</p>
<p>The group particularly noted that the next president should include Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation (DRR-CCA) in his or her platform and make it a top development agenda. 'The public demands a president with a vision of resiliency, a concrete plan to get there, and greater accountability for the thousands who have suffered from the effects of disaster and climate change,' said DRRNetPhils.</p>
<p>Although a strong executive arm is needed when it comes to DRR-CCA, the climate group also said that lawmakers are needed to reduce vulnerabilities of Filipinos to disaster and climate change while enhancing capacities and resiliency through policy reform and decisive action.</p>
<p>'As much as we need strong law enforcers, we need just lawmakers. We need lawmakers who can craft and support policies that address the all-too-often neglected rights of elderly people, women, children, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, urban poor, fisher folk, agricultural laborers, and factory workers before, during, and after disasters because they are the ones disproportionately affected and have the least capacity to recover from disasters,' DRRNetPhils stressed.' This is because laws are and remain to be our first line of defense, especially by the marginalized and vulnerable,' it said. Currently, the Philippines has two policies on disaster management and climate change adaptation -- the Climate Change Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 9729) and the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 (R.A. 10174).</p>
<p>R.A. 9729 aims to mainstream climate change adaptation into government policy and establish a framework strategy. This law created the Climate Change Commission.</p> 
<p>Government agencies and local government units (LGUs) should allocate from their annual appropriations enough funds for formulation, development, and implementation of projects under this law. Meanwhile, R.A. 10121, which focuses on prevention and mitigation, is an act mandated to strengthen disaster management in the Philippines. It replaced the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) with the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) as the focal body. Headed by the Office of Civil Defense as its implementing agency, NDRRMC coordinates with the regional, provincial and local DRRM councils.</p>
<p>The law also mandated LGUs to allot 5.0 percent of their yearly budgets to disaster mitigation, preparation, and response. Of the local disaster fund, 70 percent shall be allocated for pre-disaster measures while the rest shall be used as Quick Response Fund which serves as a stand-by fund for relief and recovery programs.</p>

<h5>Time for mining to deliver on zero casualty policy</h5>

                          <h5 class="h5 mb-3">Op-Ed | 15 February 2019 | By Mami Mizutori</h4>
                          <p>The decision by Vale, the world’s largest manufacturer of iron ore, to decommission ten of its tailings dams in Brazil is welcome, but it will seem too little, and too late, for those who have lost loved ones and seen their environments destroyed by the failures of such structures.</p>
                          
<p>Tailings dam failures over the last five years have made the headlines in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, the USA and Israel. </p>

<p>Not all have resulted in loss of life, but the damage to the environment has been extensive and raises enormous questions and safety concerns over what conditions are like at the world’s 30,000 industrial mines.</p>

<p>In 2001, the International Commission on Large Dams issued its report “Tailings Dams: Risk of Dangerous Occurrences”, which examined 221 failures. It found all of them could have been avoided.
The technical knowledge exists to build and maintain safe facilities. As a recent UN Environment Programme assessment put it: “an inadequate commitment to safe storage combined with poor management was the cause of most failures.”</p>

<p>It remains to be seen if the investigation now underway by Vale and the Brazilian authorities discovers any other factors in the failure in critical infrastructure at the Córrego de Feijão mine in Brumadinho, Brazil, which has likely claimed hundreds of lives.</p>

<p>Since the 2001 landmark report, one other risk factor for the mining industry has come into sharp relief and that is climate change. The increasing variability in global weather systems, including rainfall patterns, floods and storms, must be factored into disaster risk management at any mining site.</p>

<p>Another fundamental concern is to ensure that disaster risk governance is at the forefront of the mining industry’s approach. The safety and well-being of their employees and of the people living in surrounding communities must be paramount. It must not be profit at all costs – or indeed at any cost. Risk-informed decision making needs to be the norm.</p>

<p>The Brumadinho disaster follows the 2015 Mariana disaster at a facility co-owned by Vale and BHP Billiton which was ranked as Brazil’s worst environmental disaster. Nineteen people died as a tidal mass of tailings slurry was released, destroying the village of Bento Rodrigues; traveling 620 kms to the Atlantic Ocean and laying waste to entire fish populations, 1,400 hectares of forest and 663 kms of water works.</p>

<p>That kind of forensic detail is not yet available on the damage done by last weekend’s disaster but the long-term consequences for the habitat and the affected communities are likely to be great.
Vale CEO, Fabio Schvartsman, has said that the company has created a working group to raise the safety standard of the company’s dams.</p>

<p>This will not satisfy public opinion. Inadequate risk governance is a key driver and enabler of disasters and until there is proper and adequate regulatory oversight of these facilities, public confidence in their safety will not be restored.</p>

<p>It is time that the recommendations made in 2001 were implemented. Further recommendations from the UN Environment Programme should also be taken into account, including a safety first approach regardless of cost.</p>

<p>The global plan for reducing disaster losses, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, seeks to not only establish concrete ways in which critical infrastructure can be risk-proofed, but also exert influence with both governments and the private sector to banish complacency around the technological and environmental threats posed by such facilities.</p>

<p>I would urge the thousands of communities living with this potential threat to ensure their voices are heard and concerns are captured in both national and local strategies for reducing disaster risk.
One way the mining industry could facilitate this would be by helping to establish an open database of mine sites and tailings storage facilities.</p>

<p>This would be a fitting and lasting way for all concerned to remember those who have lost their lives in such disasters and to demonstrate that the mining industry is not just paying lip service to a zero-casualty policy.</p>

		Disasters are costing more and have long-term economic impacts on both developed and developing countries alike. Disasters cause damage worth $130 billion every year on average. But in addition to the economic losses, disasters often devastate the livelihoods of the survivors,  often for years to come. Stories from this perspective can build strong narratives that feed into DRR priorities at different levels.

		People have different perceptions of disasters and react in different ways. Some people ignore hazards and believe disasters are inevitable as acts of God or nature. But many societies realize that hazards can be identified and disasters prevented. Using traditional knowledge, people in many regions have adapted building design to withstand earthquakes, or to survive flooding. When the Indian Ocean tsunami hit in December 2004, some 230,000 people were killed throughout Asia, but only seven died out of a population of approximately 83,000 on Simeulue Island, just 40 km from the epicentre of the earthquake. Nearly the entire population on the island survived thanks to knowledge of previous tsunamis, handed down from one generation to the next.

		In poorer countries, women and children tend to be the most affected by disasters. Women are more vulnerable because of their subordinate position in the family, lack of control over the means of production, restricted mobility, limited facilities for education, lack of employment, and inequalities in food intake relative to men. As a result of Cyclone Nargis in 2008 in Myanmar, twice as many women died as men in the 18-60 age groups. Highlighting examples of women leaders in their communities across Asia and Africa can make very attractive stories, contributing to women’s empowerment.
 </p>
 
<p class="">Studies show that women, boys and girls are 14 times more likely than men to die during a   disaster (Peterson, 2007).</p>
<p class="">In 1991, during the cyclone disasters in Bangladesh, of the 140,000 people who died, 90% were women (Ikeda, 1995).</p>
<p class="">During the emergency caused by Hurricane Katrina in the United States, most of the victims trapped in New Orleans were Afro-American women with their children, the poorest demographic group in that part of the country (Gault et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2006).</p>
<p class="">Following a disaster, it is more likely that women will be victims of domestic and sexual violence; they even avoid using shelters for fear of being sexually assaulted (Davis et al., 2005).</p>

<h5>Disaster and gender statistics</h5>
<p>Neumayer and Plmper analyzed disasters in 141 countries and found that, when it came to deaths, gender differences were directly linked to women’s economic and social rights; in societies where women and men enjoyed equal rights, disasters caused the same number of deaths in both sexes.</p>
<p>They also confirmed that discrepancies were the result of existing inequalities. For example, boys were given preferential treatment during rescue efforts and, following disasters, both women and girls suffered more from shortages of food and economic resources (Neumayer and Plmper, 2007). </p>

<p>“Natural and humanitarian disasters lead to a dramatic increase in child marriages as families struggle to cope,” a campaign group said in 2015, urging governments to accelerate their efforts to end the practice. “Rates of child marriage have risen sharply and in some cases doubled in three years in Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, while in Bangladesh some families are marrying off their daughters in anticipation of recurring natural disasters, “ the campaign group Girls not Brides said.</p>
<p>"Emergency situations are often the last straw for many families who are already living on the brink," Lakshmi Sundaram, executive director of Girls Not Brides, said in a statement in Oct 2015.</p>

		DRR stories do not just have to be about the disasters themselves. Covering current risks and dangers, commemorating past disasters, reporting on disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts as well as on positive measures that can save lives, such as education and traditional knowledge, can be good stories too. The story of Tilly Smith, a young English girl on vacation in Phuket, Thailand, during the 2004 tsunami is one of them. Tilly saved hundreds of people in her hotel, thanks to a geography lesson she had in school on tsunamis before going on vacation.

		The resilience of health systems is essential to secure immediate and long-term health care and to strengthen communities’ resilience against natural and also biological hazards. It does not cost much more to include DRR principles in the design of new build health facilities and hospitals to ensure they function when they are urgently needed. In fact, it costs only 4 per cent more to make a hospital disaster resilient and safe, according to WHO.

		Journalists do more than just break the news. There are many ways of getting disaster risk reduction into the public consciousness in order to inform, educate and raise awareness and concern about a particular threat. They can question the performance of government and local government, and alert and help a vulnerable audience on the nature of the risk and how to cope with a potential disaster. They can draw attention to vulnerability and exposure, and warn of disasters in the making based on risk assessments. Such reports raise the controversial elements of bad governance, corruption, budgetary folly, and, of course, potential danger.

<p>In its role as a public service provider, the media has a responsibility to raise the profile of disaster risk reduction issues among the public at large. Media played an essential role in raising awareness about the dangers of AIDS and road safety and diminishing the number killed every year by these two threats. No one would stop using seat belts or condoms because they have never had an accident or never contracted HIV. In the same way, no one should fail to take care of their homes, workplaces or children’s schools because they have not suffered floods or earthquakes. Media can help make everybody a risk reducer and make the world safer against disasters. Media have a major role to play in the early warning chain as they are often the first ones to disseminate  early warning messages issued by the national disaster management agency.
