		In March 2015, UN member states agreed on a 15-year plan to reduce disaster risk by 2030 by endorsing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which was adopted at the Third World Conference on Disaster Reduction, in Sendai, Japan.</p>
	<p>	      
The Sendai Framework is a non-binding agreement which succeeds the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005-2015. Its goal is to reduce disaster losses by reducing existing levels of disaster risk and preventing the creation of new risk by reducing exposure and vulnerability and increasing preparedness and strengthening resilience.</p>
	<p> 
The Sendai Framework is aligned with the other 2030 Agenda framework agreements, including The Paris Agreement on Climate Change, The Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, the New Urban Agenda and, ultimately, the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>
It recognizes that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders including local government, civil society actors, the private sector and others.
</p>
<p>
UNDRR is tasked to support the implementation, follow-up and review of the Sendai Framework.

<h4>Four priorities</h4>
<p>The four priorities of the Sendai Framework indicate several of the roles the media can play in building resilience and contributing to disaster risk reduction. It plays an obvious role with regard to the fourth priority by promoting disaster preparedness among its audiences, but it can work towards other priorities as well. It can, for instance, highlight local risk perceptions and assessments in its coverage so that they come to the attention at the local and national levels, or seek information about risk governance and plans in a manner that promotes public information as well as accountability.</p>



<h4 class="mt-4">Monitoring progress under the Sendai Framework</h4>
<p>Strong accountability is one of the cornerstones of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. A set of 38 indicators has been identified by the Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group to track progress across the Sendai Framework’s seven targets and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This set of indicators allows the tracking of progress within each country and region, as well as global trends in DRR.</p>


<p>
The Sendai Framework Monitor is a management tool to help countries develop disaster risk reduction strategies, make risk-informed policy decisions and allocate resources to prevent new disaster risks. It offers journalists a template with which to explore various dimensions of their country’s progress in implementing DRR measures. It can be used to report on legislation and other measures within their countries.

		The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty that nearly 200 governments adopted in 1992 with the aim of preventing dangerous climate change. It is the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol as well as the 2015 Paris Agreement. The ultimate objective of the UNFCC and its associated agreements is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.</p>
	<p>	      
The signatories come together on a regular basis to review progress and negotiate new action during the Conference of Parties (COP). Through this treaty, COP3 produced the Kyoto Protocol, the agreement that required some industrialised countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. At the COP21 in December 2015, the Paris Agreement produced and brought about unprecedented cooperation for governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<h4>The Sendai Framework’s contribution to the SDGs</h4>  

<p class="lead mb-4">
The Sendai Framework was the first development agreement adopted in 2015. It was followed by the adoption of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 2030 Development Agenda by the General Assembly in New York in September 2015 and the new agreement on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015. 
</p>

<p>
Disaster Risk Reduction is essential to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and, in particular, three of them:<br> 
<strong>Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere</strong><br> 
<strong>Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,</strong> and<br> 
<strong>Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts</strong>

<h5>Things to know about the Sendai Framework</h5>
<p>In a piece published by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Megan Rowling, journalist specialising in development issues, climate change and disaster risk reduction, set out the background to the Sendai disaster risk reduction agreement. The following piece, published on 23 March 2015, explains the Sendai Framework.</p>

                          <h4 class="h3 mb-3">Ten things to know about the Sendai disaster risk reduction deal </h4>
                          <p>International agreements - whatever subject they address - are never going to make everyone happy. The same is true for the new global disaster risk reduction plan, adopted after a 40-hour negotiating session in Japan last week.
</p><p>                       
The Sendai framework is built to last for the next 15 years, and as the first of three major deals due to be struck this year on sustainable development and climate change, it attracted a high level of political interest - certainly more than usual for the theme.
</p><p>
As the talks went down to the wire, there was relief a compromise was reached on tricky issues like targets, finance and climate change. And afterwards, some said the political jostling could be a positive signal that disaster risk reduction is finally getting the attention it deserves.
</p><p>
But some aid agencies, which work with those most vulnerable to disasters, said the new framework had been weakened by the manoeuvring, and were especially disappointed it did not contain a concrete goal to boost funding for developing countries to strengthen their disaster prevention and response.
Here are 10 things worth knowing about what's in the final agreement, and what got left out:
</p><p>
1. Targets: The Sendai framework - unlike its predecessor The Hyogo Framework for Disaster Risk reduction- includes seven targets intended to drive forward progress on protecting people and assets from extreme weather and other natural and manmade hazards.
</p><p>
These are to "substantially reduce" the numbers of people killed and affected by disasters, as well as damage to infrastructure and services like health and education, and to decrease economic losses - all by 2030.
</p><p>
The others are to increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020, enhance international cooperation for developing countries by 2030, and boost access to early warning systems and disaster risk information for the public by 2030.
</p><p>
These targets proved controversial because some countries had wanted them to include specific percentage goals. While those disappeared, timeframes for lowering losses were retained for deaths and the number of affected people. Experts were also pleased that a working group will now be set up to develop indicators to measure progress on the targets - something they argue is sorely needed.
 </p><p>
2. Finance: It was never thought likely that rich nations would be lining up in Sendai to make major new funding announcements for disaster risk reduction measures in developing countries, nor that the new framework would include percentage targets for finance.
</p><p>
But those who had called for more money were disappointed the final deal doesn't even commit clearly to increasing financial aid, settling on a much vaguer target to "substantially enhance international cooperation to developing countries through adequate and sustainable support".
</p><p>
Vulnerable countries had wanted to include words such as "additional" and "predictable" with regard to funding, but these were opposed by wealthy governments. Japan did pledge assistance worth $4 billion over the next four years, including training for 40,000 people, but it's unclear where the money will come from, and how much of it will be loans and technical support in kind.
</p><p>
There are hopes more funds will be promised for disaster risk reduction at an international development financing summit in Ethiopia in July.
</p><p>
3. Climate change: Climate politics burst onto the scene in Sendai - even threatening the prospects of reaching a deal towards the end. That's perhaps not surprising, when close to 90 percent of disasters are caused by weather and climate extremes, according to the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.
But while Sendai was not the place for working out how to tackle climate change, some developing countries had wanted the disaster deal to address principles of fairness around who is responsible for causing - and thus providing compensation for - global warming, and the losses and damage from its impacts.
</p><p>
The framework acknowledges climate change as "one of the drivers of disaster risk" - language some governments tried to remove and says it should be tackled across inter-governmental processes while respecting the mandate of the U.N. body that runs the separate climate change negotiations.
Importantly, it makes a link between the level of support provided to developing states, their differing capacities, and the extent to which they will be able to implement the Sendai agreement.
</p><p>
4. Connections with other 2015 deals: Going into the conference, development experts criticized the Sendai draft agreement for weak linkages with the U.N. climate talks, due to produce a binding pact in Paris in December, and the process for hammering out a new set of global development goals, which will come to fruition in September in New York.
</p><p>
Some wanted the targets for disaster risk reduction set in Sendai to be coherent with those in the Sustainable Development Goals - and the agreement proposes indicators be developed in conjunction, which could help. But critics said there is still little substantive on connecting the three processes in the final version of the text.
 </p><p>
5. Nuclear disasters: In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear crisis in 2011, following the tsunami that hit Japan's north-eastern coast, Japanese civil society groups had pushed hard to ensure the new global plan included a reference to man-made and technological hazards, which were only a footnote in the previous Hyogo framework. The Sendai plan states that it applies to disasters caused by these hazards, as well as natural ones - a move described by a Japanese NGO coalition as "great progress". 
</p><p>
6. Health: There was widespread praise for the much higher profile given to health matters in the Sendai framework. The plan calls for measures to protect people's health by reducing damage to hospitals and clinics and ensuring medical treatment continues in disasters, as well as tackling the risks of epidemics and pandemics.
</p><p>
This is particularly pertinent in the wake of the year-old Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has caused huge loss of life and weakened economies, while highlighting the vulnerability of poorly developed health systems. 
</p><p>
7. Human rights: Rights advocates had lobbied for the Sendai framework to take a strong approach to human rights, which are often violated in disasters. The final text says that managing the risk of disasters is aimed at protecting persons and their property, health, livelihoods and productive assets, as well as cultural and environmental assets, "while promoting and protecting all human rights, including the right to development". This language was welcomed by experts.
</p><p>
8. Displacement: With news before Sendai that the risk of being displaced by disasters has doubled over the past four decades, hopes were high that the new framework would address the issue.
</p><p>
The Sendai agreement notes that 144 million people were forced from their homes between 2008 and 2012 by disasters, and urges effective policies to address their situation, including the provision of safe shelter, but does not go into detail on the issue. It also calls on governments to acknowledge the role migrants can play in reducing disaster risk. 
</p><p>
9. Women, children and the disabled: Women's rights experts welcomed the statement in the Sendai framework that disaster risk policy and practices require a gender perspective, and that women should play a leading role in disaster prevention and response, as well as being given access to sexual and reproductive healthcare in disasters.
</p><p>
Another positive was the call for decision-making to be based on data that is broken down according to gender, age and disability, allowing the impact of disasters on women, children, the elderly and disabled people to be better understood. 
</p><p>
The text also mentions that children and youth must be given the space and the means to contribute their knowledge and skills, and highlights the importance of including and consulting with vulnerable groups.
</p><p>
The Sendai conference was praised for being accessible to people with disabilities, more than 200 of whom participated through the use of Braille documents, sign-language interpretation and transportation for delegates in wheelchairs.
 </p><p>
10. Animals: After two years of lobbying, World Animal Protection said the inclusion in the Sendai plan of the need to keep livestock and working animals safe in disasters is a big achievement that will enable more people to get back on their feet after a disaster strikes.
</p><p>
More than 1 billion of the world's poorest people rely on animals for food, transport and their livelihoods, and addressing animal protection in the Sendai framework will help governments and communities take animals into account in disaster planning and preparation, the group said.
