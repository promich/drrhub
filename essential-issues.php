Media coverage is often selective, not comprehensive, and it creates narratives that gather momentum to the extent that they determine how disasters and various actors in the response to disasters are viewed in the public eye. Media narratives also determine where blame is laid, and who is blamed for failures or appreciated for an effective disaster response. </p>
<p>
Hurricane Katrina, which hit the city of New Orleans in the USA in 2005, and the 9/11 attacks in 2001 represent the power of public perception that arises from media coverage. While in the former case, the meta-narrative that emerged was about the failure of the government, the media narrative in the latter case created a supportive consensus between the people, the media and the government. Similar examples of dominant narratives abound in the various national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.</p>
<p>
Media narratives gather momentum because the media is often ‘self-referential’, that is, journalists can be guided by the angles covered by other journalists even as they compete with each other. Simply put, once a topic or perspective gains attention, it attracts more attention – and because it attracts more attention, it becomes newsworthy and creates a news wave. It is important to recognise this and make attempts to break this loop where appropriate. </p>

<h5>The ethics of aiding those in distress</h5>
<p>The Association of Health Care Journalists, based at the Missouri School of Journalism in the USA, offers this advice:</p>

<p>Reporting on war, natural disaster, and epidemics – and alerting the world to human suffering and need – serves a compelling public interest. On such assignments, journalists inevitably encounter people with urgent needs for shelter, food, or medical attention. Human decency prompts many journalists to offer aid and comfort to people who are suffering, but reporters must not profit from these acts nor exploit those whom they help.</p>

                          <p>Reporting on war, natural disaster, and epidemics – and alerting the world to human suffering and need – serves a compelling public interest. On such assignments, journalists inevitably encounter people with urgent needs for shelter, food, or medical attention. Human decency prompts many journalists to offer aid and comfort to people who are suffering, but reporters must not profit from these acts nor exploit those whom they help.
</p><p>
People in distress who receive aid from a journalist may feel obligated to help that journalist in his or her job. Even under difficult reporting conditions, journalists must ensure that subjects of news reports and photos, audio, and video recordings give consent freely. If journalists have given aid, they should seek other faces for their stories.  Journalists who also are doctors, nurses or other health care professionals should consider as well the Hippocratic Oath and other professional standards that require caregivers to "keep secret" what they glean from patients.
</p><p>
Giving aid to people in need is natural and often commendable, but in a media environment where celebrity brings financial rewards, stories that feature journalists' aid efforts elevate their personal interests and those of their employers above the public's interest.
</p><p>
In summary, do not exploit vulnerability for gain or glory.

This is one of the big issues in the coverage of disasters, especially when they are happening and in their immediate aftermath.</p>
<p class="lead mb-4">
In some cases, journalists may find themselves first on the scene, even before the arrival of emergency services. Though their primary job is to get the information out from that location to the wider world, they might be confronted by distressed people whose real needs are medical care, reassurance, food, water and shelter. This is a real dilemma that many disaster journalists face. </p>

There is an intense desire to know what is happening and how that will affect people’s lives during disasters, but the public’s right to know can come into conflict with the wider interest of those very groups. One such example can be seen in the leak of information about a quarantine plan in northern Italy, which was revealed by a newspaper the day before it was to come into effect, thus nullifying it and creating far more widespread problems for Italy as a whole. Leaks and disclosures on such sensitive matters deserve thorough editorial consideration at the highest levels of the media, and the journalistic imperative to be first with the story should not be the only factor taken into account.</p>

Italy experienced its highest day-on-day rise in deaths from coronavirus on Sunday and was plunged into chaos after details of a plan to quarantine more than 16 million people were leaked to the press, sending thousands into panic as they tried to flee.</p>
<p>
The whole of Lombardy, including the financial capital of Milan, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions, have been shut down until 3 April as Italy grapples to contain the spread of a virus as deaths rose from 233 to 366, a rise of more than 50% in 24 hours, with the total number of cases so far at 7,375.</p>
<p>
Thousands crowded train stations or jumped into their cars after a draft decree banning people from leaving or entering the region was revealed by Corriere della Sera late on Saturday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“What happened with the news leak has caused many people to try to escape, causing the opposite effect of what the decree is trying to achieve,” warned Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan. “Unfortunately some of those who fled will be infected with the disease.”

Information gathered from social media is invaluable to journalists, but it also presents a number of problems. Content circulating on social media can often include rumours, fear-mongering, one-sided perspectives, misguided solutions, unfounded predictions, false cures, dangerous mythology, decontextualized or recontextualized videos, and perspectives that stigmatise certain social groups.
</p>
<p>
Journalists across the world now use several verification techniques to detect fake news, prevent the spread of misinformation and safeguard their own credibility. These include analysing the social media accounts from where information is originating, reverse image searches, video analysis, and journalistic verification which can be as simple as getting in touch with the individual spreading that information.

Hard data – verified data – is critical at all stages of covering disasters and promoting resilience. Data is central to taking informed decisions about courses of action. People want to know what is going on, whether it is about risk or impact or preparedness. Graphs and charts in stories put out by the media make for much better impact and audience comprehension.</p>
<p>
Data represents reality, but of course there are pitfalls. One is that data may not be complete. Another is that data is presented in the language of experts and journalists have to put in the required work to understand what each indicator or data point represents, as with all the information data that surrounds the COVID-19 pandemic – ranging from the basic reproduction number of an infection (R0) to mortality rates, death rates, excess deaths, recovery rates, types and numbers of tests, and economic impacts.
</p>
<p>
Science lies behind each element of data and this science differs from disaster to disaster, so journalists must put in the required homework to ensure that they understand what scientists are talking about so that they can be sure not to distort its meaning in their output.
</p>
<p> 
Journalists rightly demand data from authorities, but that data may not exist, or it may be premature to release it.  So, it is important to be patient and realistic, and to avoid adopting confrontational positions without being aware of the various reasons why data is not always readily available.

<h5>News story: How Virginia Juked Its COVID-19 Statistics</h5>
<p>The state is combining results from viral and antibody tests in the same statistic. This threatens to confound America’s understanding of the pandemic.</p>

The U.S. now routinely claims to conduct more than 300,000 tests a day, according to state-level data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic.</p>

<p>
The United States’ ability to test for the novel coronavirus finally seems to be improving. As recently as late April, the country rarely reported more than 150,000 new test results each day. The U.S. now routinely claims to conduct more than 300,000 tests a day, according to state-level data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic.
</p><p>
But these rosy numbers may conceal a problem: A lack of federal guidelines has created huge variation in how states are reporting their COVID-19 data and in what kind of data they provide to the public.
</p><p>
These gaps can be used for political advantage. In at least one state, Virginia, senior officials are blending the results of two different types of coronavirus test in order to report a more favourable result to the public. This harms the integrity of the data they use to make decisions, reassure residents, and justify reopening their economies.
</p><p>
Other differences make it hard to track the pandemic. In at least three other states, officials have lumped together probable and confirmed COVID-19 deaths; most don’t specify how they’re counting deaths. While most states report the number of people who have been tested for the coronavirus, six states say they track the number of samples that have been tested—and California and New Jersey switched methods in the last few weeks. Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Vermont, and New York do not report the racial or ethnic breakdown of coronavirus cases. Even more states fail to report the racial breakdown of deaths. It is still impossible to know, for example, how many black people have died of COVID-19, though the data that does exist suggests that black people are dying at much higher levels than other groups.
</p><p>
There are many ways that the lack of data has complicated the outbreak. Until May 12, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not reported state-level testing data, leaving efforts like our COVID Tracking Project to fill that gap. The lack of reliable national testing data has made it difficult for modelers, policy analysts, and others to understand the true scope of the outbreak. Data about hospitalizations has been even harder to understand. Because the states report hospitalization counts in fundamentally different ways, there is no way to calculate the number of people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in the U.S.

Experts may feel that journalists are oversimplifying their perspectives and not reflecting the complexity of the situation. This is not entirely unfounded, for there are often no clear answers in real-life situations and dilemmas, which require a balancing of different priorities rather than a clear-cut yes and no answer. An illustration is provided by the discussions over imposing and lifting lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, with competing imperatives around life and livelihood or wealth and wellbeing.

 To deal with the complexity and uncertainty that abound in critical situations such as disasters, it is important to:	
</p>	

<ul>
	<li class="mb-2">
	Recognise that real-life situations are complex and there is often no one clear answer
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2">
Understand the logic that lies behind each of the competing priorities, and to acknowledge that they can all be valid
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2">
Emphasise long-term contact with experts as well as development and training of reporters in these areas
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2">
Be wary of one-sided or simplistic solutions to complex problems 	
	</li>
</ul>
