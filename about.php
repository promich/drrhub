              <p class="leader mb-3">When the coronavirus disease pandemic brought the world to a halt in 2020, it affected every aspect of human life around the world and exemplified the scale and range of problems that disasters bring in their wake.</p> 
              <p class="leader mb-5">Its global impact highlights the urgency and importance of concerted planning and collective action to reduce disaster risk and build resilience.</p>
              
              
              
              
              <p class="lead mb-4">The COVID-19 pandemic is the most disruptive disaster in living memory, but though it is unique in its scale and global impact, its nature is by no means unique. It was a stark reminder of the fact that when risks and hazards develop into disasters, they have the potential to disrupt multiple dimensions of human life. Global warming and the climate change associated with it is another obvious example. Its onset may not be as sudden, but it is becoming apparent that its impact will be as far-reaching and severe.

Journalists play a crucial role in disseminating information before, during and after disasters of all types, ranging from disasters triggered by natural hazards to human-initiated ones. However, research also suggests that journalists are often unprepared to cover many types of disasters. Journalists must plan to increase their level of preparedness to cover disasters, just as governments and international bodies must plan to build resilience to disasters.

<p class="lead mb-4">
Journalists often specialize in areas such as economics, education or health. However, disaster risk reduction (DRR) or fostering disaster resilience is seldom considered a beat worthy of similar attention. This handbook addresses reporters and broadcasters who want to know more about those urgent, terrifying and all-too-often tragic moments when a populated built environment is challenged by the forces of nature or a man-made disaster. It draws upon the expertise of journalists, disaster experts and researchers to take a comprehensive and systemic approach. It emphasises the multidimensional and interconnected nature of the risks we face and puts forward a blend of practical information, professional approaches and underlying principles for the effective reporting of disasters.
